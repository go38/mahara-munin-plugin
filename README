NAME
    mahara_ - Plugin for monitoring various Mahara stats

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration is done through libpq environment variables, for example
    PGUSER, PGHOST, etc. But generally it is easier if you run the plugin on
    the database server as postgres user. For more information, see
    Munin::Plugin::Pgsql and
    <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/plugin-conf.d>.

    In order to make this plugin work, you need to specify the name of the
    mahara database via symlink to the plugin, i.e. mahara_<databasename>.
    For more information see
    <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/WildcardPlugins>.

    Plugin configuration variables:

    env.updatetime - you may configure the period for which the time-based
    data is calculated (e.g. used in the number of logged-in users reporting
    or assignments submissions). By default the value of 300 sec is used (5
    min Munin default update interval).

    env.dbprefix - if you use specific database prefix set the correct value
    using this parameter.

    env.showdefaultpages - whether to show default/system pages on the graph
    (user dashboard, user profile, group home page). Can be enabled by
    setting this variable to 1. Disabled by default.
